    "The city of Austin, Texas, is one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States in the number of people moving there each year.  In 2018, the population of Austin grew by 2.5%, with an estimated 100 people moving to the Austin metro area each day .  It is home to the University of Texas and a growing technology industry.  It is also growing in affluence, median income increased 9.35% over the past three years compared to the national average of 5.60%. Putting these factors together, Austin seems to offer a fertile opportunity for new business.\n",

    "Even before Austin became a \"go-to destination\" for relocation, it was well known for its nightlife and its live music scene earning it the nickname of \"Live Music Capital of the World.\"  Surprisingly, a preliminary examination of venues in Austin shows a lack of traditional Irish Pubs, defined as a place that combines not only the service of food and drink and traditional Irish Music, not just a place that serves Guinness.   Given that Irish Music has influenced many of the music genres that Austin is noted for, a traditional Irish pub could strike a balance in being both something different and yet familiar with broad appeal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question, of course, is where is the ideal location to put open such a business and using data science analysis, this project attempts to answer this question\n"
